# Massive_data_Exact_Diagonalization
This repository allows you to use the exact diagonalization method, i.e., Quspin library, and create Massive data, in this particular example, single-particle correlation in the Bose-Hubbard Model Hamiltonian, for specifically deep learning purposes. This can be easily extended to different Hamiltonians to study different quantum many-body problems
